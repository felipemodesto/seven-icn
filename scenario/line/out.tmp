RUNTIME ERROR. A cRuntimeError exception is about to be thrown, and you
requested (by setting debug-on-errors=true in the ini file) that errors
abort execution and break into the debugger.

You should now probably be running the simulation under gdb or another
debugger. The simulation kernel will now raise a SIGINT signal which will
get you into the debugger. If you are not running under a debugger, you can
still use the core dump for post-mortem debugging. Once in the debugger,
view the call stack (in gdb: "bt" command) to see the context of the
runtime error.

<!> Error in module (omnetpp::cModule) BaconScenario (id=1) during network setup: Submodule statistics: cannot resolve module type `BaconStatistics' (not in the loaded NED files?).

TRAPPING on the exception above, due to a debug-on-errors=true configuration option. Is your debugger ready?
FAILED: run aborted
